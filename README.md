# Startpage

A simple yet effective page to keep all your go to websites, also includes a duckduckgo search bar.

## Usage

```bash
mkdir <dir_name>
cd <dir_name>
git init
git clone https://github.com/CodeForMMA/startpage.git
```

From here you can set the `.html` file as your homepage for whatever browser you're using.
Fyi: This has only been tested with Firefox.
